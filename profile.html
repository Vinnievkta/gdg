      <h1 class="name">Joe </h1>
      <p class="bio">Hi everyone! It’s nice to meet you.

        My name’s Joe (Joseph if you’re my Mom) and I am a 31 year old gay male, six foot, 190 pounds, and if you know anything about the gay-lingo this should be familiar – masculine and athletic.
        
        I enjoy long runs on the beach, reading, video games, the gym, yoga, meditation, and cross fit. I spend most of my time working on a few businesses, playing with my dogs and being with friends and family. I don’t go out too often, but I enjoy myself when I do.</p>
